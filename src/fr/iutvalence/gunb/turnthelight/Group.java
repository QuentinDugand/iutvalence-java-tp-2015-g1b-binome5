 * Object necessary to the state's changes. A light belongs to a group.

 * The class "group" define the objects which characterizes the state changes of a light.
 * It exists 3 types of lights, because of the differences that they show when they change their states.
 * We have lights that have 2 lights around of them which change at the same time. They are positioned in the corners of the grid.
 * We have lights that have 3 lights around of them which change at the same time. They are positioned in the edges of the grid.
 * We have lights that have 4 lights around of them which change at the same time. They are positioned everywhere else.
 * To define how many lights must change their state at the same time, we create a group for each case.
